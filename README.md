# Edit Distance

An app to check the words that are correctly written (Spell checking).
It uses Levenshtein distance algorithm for finding the distance between 2 words.
The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

The algorithm was implanted with Dynamic Programing and C++ for better result time.
It checks every word written in the text box when you write it you can also use copy/paste.
